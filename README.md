# FiniteElement1D
This project is an exploration of the impact of different boundary conditions on a transport-diffusion equation (or Fokker-Planck) on a 1D finite element scheme. From theory (consistency, stability, comparison with a finite difference scheme) to numerical (python code and visualization).
